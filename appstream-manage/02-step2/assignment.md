To support the web application deployed on this machine, install postgresql version 9.6.

```bash
yum -y module install postgresql:9.6
```

After the installation is complete, verify that postgresql version 9.6 is installed on the system.

```bash
yum module list postgresql
```

Notice that version 9.6 is now marked as [e]nabled under the Stream column and is flagged as [i]nstalled in the Profiles column of the listing for postgresql.

Finally, run the postgres command to inspect the version it reports.

```bash
postgres --version
```
