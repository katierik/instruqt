Now that the yum repositories are defined within the container, you can use
another `yum install`, executed within the container, to install the target
software: `moon-buggy`.

```bash
buildah run ubi-working-container -- yum -y install moon-buggy
```

From the above output, you can see that `moon-buggy` was successfully installed
into the container.  The `yum` transaction also installed several required
pieces of software as well.
