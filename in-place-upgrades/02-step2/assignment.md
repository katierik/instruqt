# Running the pre-upgrade assistant and resolving issues

Built into the leapp tool is a utility that collects data about the system, assesses upgradability, and generates a pre-upgrade report. On your lab system, perform the pre-upgrade test: (This process will take a couple minutes.)

```
leapp preupgrade --target 8.6
```

<pre class=file>
# leapp preupgrade --target 8.6
==> Processing phase `configuration_phase`
====> * ipu_workflow_config
        IPU workflow config actor
==> Processing phase `FactsCollection`
====> * system_facts
        Provides data about many facts from system.
====> * scan_files_for_target_userspace
        Scan the source system and identify files that will be copied into the target userspace when it is created.
====> * firewalld_facts_actor
        Provide data about firewalld
====> * removed_pam_modules_scanner
        Scan PAM configuration for modules that are not available in RHEL-8.
====> * network_manager_read_config
        Provides data about NetworkManager configuration.

Notice how the upgrade was "inhibited" because the preupgrade assistant requires your input on one or more issues before it will safely proceed. The preupgrade tool has generated an answerfile in `/var/log/leapp`. Inside of this file, it has generated a true/false question regarding PAM PKCS11 modules:

```
cat /var/log/leapp/answerfile
```

<pre class=file>
# cat /var/log/leapp/answerfile
[remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check]
# Title:              None
# Reason:             Confirmation
# =================== remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check.confirm ==================
# Label:              Disable pam_pkcs11 module in PAM configuration? If no, the upgrade process will be interrupted.
# Description:        PAM module pam_pkcs11 is no longer available in RHEL-8 since it was replaced by SSSD.
# Reason:             Leaving this module in PAM configuration may lock out the system.
# Type:               bool
# Default:            None
# Available choices: True/False
# Unanswered question. Uncomment the following line with your answer
# confirm =
</pre>

In this scenario, PAM modules are not in use. It is therefore safe to skip this check. To do so, replace the commented line `# confirm =` with a true statement.

```
sed -i 's/# confirm =/confirm = true/g' /var/log/leapp/answerfile
```

OPTIONAL: Re-run the preupgrade check to verify the change satisfied the result
