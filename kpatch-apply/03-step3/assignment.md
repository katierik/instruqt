## Applying a Kernel Live Patch

You could now install the specific kpatch-patch package you discovered from the
previous step.  However, if you were wanting to do this action on a population
of systems, which may each be running a different kernel (because of where they
are in your normal population maintenance, perhaps).  Instead, Red Hat
recommends using a dnf install or update command that embeds a uname -r
command to dynamically determine the running kernel version and utilize it
when making the decision of which kpatch to install:

```bash
dnf -y install "kpatch-patch = $(uname -r)"
```

The previous `dnf` command, based on the result of the embedded uname -r
command, installed kpatch-patch-4_18_0-348_12_2, which is what you had
determined on the previous step to be the patchset for this system.
