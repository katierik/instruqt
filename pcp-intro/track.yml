title: Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to understand the basics of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) in RHEL, and use PCP to analyze the performance of Microsoft SQL Server running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Install Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) packages on RHEL
  * Analyze critical system resources using PCP
  * Install Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA) for SQL Server
  * Analyze SQL Server performance by running a sample columnstore-based analytic query using SQL Server

  >**BACKGROUND:** The first step to solving performance issues is being able to diagnose the issue. If you don’t have performance metrics and the ability to analyze them, you’re just relying on guesswork. One of the popular tools for performance monitoring on Linux is Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), and we’ll show you how to get started using PCP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to collect and analyze data to solve your performance mysteries.
