title: Installing and configuring Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  using RHEL System Roles
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to use Ansible playbooks
  to install and configure Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Verify whether ansible is installed on the system
  * Downloading the ansible role for SQL Server from ansible galaxy
  * Viewing and editing the ansible playbook variables
  * Running the playbook to install and configure Microsoft SQL Server on RHEL 8
  * Login to SQL Server and query a table

  # Example Use case:
  Your IT team requires a uniform and streamlined way to install Microsoft SQL Server
  across multiple RHEL servers. The SQL Server instances must also be setup using a uniform
  configuration, and the installation process must be repeatable when more servers
  come online.
